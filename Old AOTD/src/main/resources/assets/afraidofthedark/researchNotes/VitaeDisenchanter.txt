Frickin bane of arthropods! Why is this stupid stuff even in the ga- er universe. After being plagued with one of the
many useless enchantments one too many times, I have decided forsake my worship of the RNG in favor of a better option.
The vitae disenchanter has two modes, which are toggled by activating it with an empty hand. The blue mode consumes
an enchanted item other than books and produces an unenchanted item along with the enchantments it previously held
stored in books. The process cannot be started without enough books or vitae. The green mode turns enchanted books
into bottles o' enchanting and empty books at the cost of vitae. Mass disenchanting and xp recycling will take a good
deal of vitae, so I should probably have a vitae lantern at the ready.
