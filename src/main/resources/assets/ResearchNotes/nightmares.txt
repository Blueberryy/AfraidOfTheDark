Since the night of my mountain top astronomy, I have been having recurring nightmares.
Most often, I will be dreaming and a long deceased friend will talk to me. Each time, I
am surprised to see her alive in well. We embrace in joy, as I place my hand on the back
of her head. Her hair feels knotted and falls out in my hand. As I open my eyes, I am met not
with the image of my friend, but with that of a rigid skeletal corpse. As I back away from her,
she rips out a handful of her once golden hair and screams in a voice that sounds like a
sandstorm, "YOUR FAULT!" She screams this over and over until I wake up. When I woke, I could
not move. My limbs felt paralyzed and I could do nothing but move my eyes. Out of the corner of
my eye, I could see Her standing there in my room with the knife she used to kill herself, all
those winters ago, How could this be? How is She here? I cannot sleep. If I sleep,
I will see Her again. She will stand there with her bloody knife, dripping, accusing me.
Why? Why do you haunt me?
