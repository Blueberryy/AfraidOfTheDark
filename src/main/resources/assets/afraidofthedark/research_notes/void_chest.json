  "pre": "All this meteor searching has lead me to notice strange buildings in the surrounding area, one of which has the appearance of a chest.",
  "researched": "After travelling through the massive underground chest, I think I have a clue as to how it works. If my theory is correct, it basically functions as a massive enderchest for people. I have devised a much smaller version of the large void chest. My newest creation is the same size as a regular chest. When opened, it will suck in the one who lifted its lid and draw them inside itself. If the void chest is destroyed, it can simply be replaced by another one without anything inside being lost, similar to an ender chest. The first person who activates a void chest will be its owner until it is broken, meaning unwanted guests cannot enter. However, if I want to enable a friend to visit the inside of my chest, I simply right click the void chest with a name tag that has the name of the friend on it. Trying to add a friend when they are already added will instead remove them. All void chests owned by one person will lead to the same location. Void chests owned by one person do not share a friend list and breaking a void chest will reset the owner and delete all friends on that particular chest."
