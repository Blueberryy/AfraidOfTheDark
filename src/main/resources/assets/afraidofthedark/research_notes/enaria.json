  "researched": "Now that I have defeated Enaria, secrets have unveiled themselves about a new power. I have always adored reading about the ancient mages of the past able to detonate mountains with a simple blink. After Enaria's fall, I felt beset by a compelling influential presence. I wonder what it may unveil to me."
