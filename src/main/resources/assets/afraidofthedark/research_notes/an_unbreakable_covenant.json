  "researched": "I have recently signed this very journal in my own blood. From what I've seen so far from working with it, it appears to be otherworldly in origin. It also appears that I am the only one who can read it. I suspect that the notes I write in it are stored in an extra-dimensional location and then projected into my mind when I look at the pages. I further suspect that if I were to lose track of this journal, I could just look for a replacement and it would still contain all of my original notes and research. I have decided to organize my research in different sections based on relevance. I am certain that new opportunities will open themselves to me as I uncover more information. I can also return to the research tree by clicking the bookmark below. Additionally, I can run into others' research in the wilderness. This will take the form of research scrolls. Simply finding these scrolls and reading them will let me copy their notes into my own journal. Sometimes, there will be multiple multiple parts to a scroll and it will be labelled as such eg: part seven of nine. Sometimes, there may be stories or histories coming in multiple volumes which also contain hints for future researches."
