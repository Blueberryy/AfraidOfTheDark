  "pre": "The enchanted skeletons I found in the underground dungeon appear to drop enchanted bones. These bones shake and quiver when placed close together in my hands... maybe I could experiment a little and drop them together on the ground somewhere?",
  "researched": "I just witnessed a pile of bones become animated. While enchanted skeletons do not do a lot of damage and appear simple to kill, they recombine after being killed and re-animate like zombies. I should try to contain the enchanted bones separately to keep them from combining. As far as I can tell, the bones are not useful for anything except bonemeal. I have also collected all the other dye recipes here for reference."
