  "researched": "I woke up in my own dreams on an island floating nowhere. Red fogs and mists swirled around me. This place is insanity itself. I can almost feel my thoughts degrading from the oppressive atmosphere. Although I wish for nothing else but to leave, I know that I must stay and search for whatever treasure I may find here."
