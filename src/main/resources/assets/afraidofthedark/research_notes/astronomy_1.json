  "pre": "I have failed to kill the wolves. Science has failed to deliver rational answers to the source of their power. I will have to use unorthodox methods if I want to survive. I think that I should construct a telescope and take it to a high place so I can see through the clouds. Perhaps the stars can provide answers to this problem which is clearly not of this world.",
  "researched": "Success! My attempts at astrology and divination have yielded scientific answers! I spotted several types of meteors falling through the night sky. I think that if I follow these to their crash locations, I can discover useful materials."
