  "pre": "Despite my successes with astral silver, there is reason to be wanting more. I know there must be more advanced methods of combating werewolves and the undead legions. I recall once reading about areas in the world where strange energies caused trees to grow extraordinarily tall and twisted. I should visit one of these locations to perhaps enhance the quality of my astral silver tools. I should look for these forests in flat areas.",
  "researched": "It seems that I am not the first person to have the idea to explore this place. I found a small, yet deserted compound within the dark forest. I cannot shake this erie feeling of doom this place gives me."
