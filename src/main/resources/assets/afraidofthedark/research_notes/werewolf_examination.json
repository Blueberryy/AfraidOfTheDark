  "pre": "I have noticed several monstrous wolves around the countryside. They look extremely dangerous, but I cannot resist getting a closer look at them! They exist in abundance in Erie forests, which is the first place I should start looking for them.",
  "researched": "My encounter with the large wolves almost ended in my own death. From what I saw, I can determine that they are extremely hardy and almost impervious to conventional weapons. For now I should avoid them until I can find some... unconventional ways of killing them."
