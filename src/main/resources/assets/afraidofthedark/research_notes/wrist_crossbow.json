  "pre": "The crossbow is clunky and large. Every time into the fray I charge. It just slows me down an' I take a poundin' while the bow I try to recharge. It is extraordinarily bad, and it always makes me quite mad. I wish it was better. It just seems like a fetter. I'd run faster, but I'm iron clad. I just wish it wasn't so useless! This really is killing my hubris. To thy own self me true. Yes, people like you! Oh piss off you old man Confucius! The crossbow just needs an upgrade. With someone, maybe I could trade. Except not a village, the last one I pillaged, and they always need to be paid.",
  "researched": "Evidently, someone else shared my opinions on the uselessness of the crossbow and has invented an interesting solution. They have made the crossbow wrist mounted, leaving the reloading to a spring-loaded mechanism. This change will allow me to hold a weapon or tool while still firing projectiles on a short cool down. Now I'd better steal this person's notes and potions before they get back..."
