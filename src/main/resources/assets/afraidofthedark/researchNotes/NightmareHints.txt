To whomever finds this: don't stay here. This place is evil. I have been stuck here for longer than I can remeber.
I can hear the abyss calling to me. It becons me to jump, calling my name. I've found all of the notes, but I cannot
leave with them. There are ten scrolls hidden here. Three are in the tallest tower, with two being near the top
and one being near the bottom. The saw mill whispers such sweet things to be. The stone tower says that it has two
gifts for me. What pretty things they have, so many rings. Enaria's bones whisper to me from her grave. I'm sorry
; we tried to save you! Her whispers make me want to hide inside of the log. The roof top rooms are hiding something
from me. They always stay quiet when I am near. I know they are keeping secrets from me! What has it told you? What
has the monolith told you to make you stop talking to me? Answer me Enaria! Where have you gone? Have you left me?
You said we would be together forever!
