The crossbow is clunky and large. Every time into the fray I charge. It just slows me down an' 
I take a poundin' while the bow I try to recharge. It is extraordinarily bad, and it 
always makes me quite mad. I wish it was better. It just seems like a fetter. I'd run faster, 
but I'm iron clad. I just wish it wasn't so useless! This really is killing my hubris. To thy 
own self me true. Yes, people like you! Oh piss off you old man Confucius! The crossbow just 
needs an upgrade. With someone, maybe I could trade. Except not a village, the last one I pillaged, 
and they always need to be paid.
