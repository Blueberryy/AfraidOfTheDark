I have failed to kill the wolves. Science has failed to deliver rational answers to the
source of their power. I will have to use unorthodox methods if I want to survive. I think
that I should construct a telescope and take it to a high mountain. Perhaps the stars
can provide answers to this problem which is clearly not of this world.
