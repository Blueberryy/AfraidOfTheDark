While the table before me makes little sense, I can comprehend the basics. Firstly, this spell table looks like
a mirror reflecting any spells I have encountered or created. I can forget spells, create new spells, edit spells,
and fire off spells in various ways. (*cough* key-bindings *cough*) Editing spells looks complex, but after some 
careful inspection the table becomes clear. I can name a spell whatever I desire. It would appear each spell requires
a source of power tap from to trigger the spell. It would also appear that each spell is divided into separate spell 
stages. Each spell stage is preceded by a delivery method. This delivery method defines how a given spell reaches its 
target. For example, a projectile flies through the air until it hits its target. Once the delivery method reaches its 
destination, it applies any of the proceeding effects (up to four). As well as this, it will trigger the next spell stages'
delivery method. The way in which the next delivery method is fired depends on the previous delivery method.
I'm sure that further perusing of my surroundings in the overworld will help discover more spell effects, delivery methods, and 
power sources. Unfortunately, it currently appears that only whispers in the nightmare allow me to conjure up and edit new spells.
I hope to find a way to do this in the comfort of my home at some point.
