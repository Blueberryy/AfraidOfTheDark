While the table before me looks quite incongruous, I can grasp the basics. After peering into the table it becomes
apparent that this spell table resembles a mirror reflecting any spells I have created into my mind. I have the ability to
forget spells, create new spells, edit spells, and fire off spells in various ways. *cough* key-bindings *cough*
Editing spells looks about as complex as proving P = NP, but after some careful inspection the table becomes more distinguishable.
I can easily name a spell whatever I desire. After probing the magical block, it would appear each spell requires
a source of power to tap from to trigger the spell. It would also seem that each spell is divided into separate spell 
stages. Each spell stage is preceded by a delivery method. This delivery method defines how a given spell reaches its 
target. For example, a projectile flies through the air until it reaches its target. Once the delivery method reaches its 
destination, it applies any of the proceeding effects. As well as this, it will trigger the next spell stage's
delivery method. The way in which the next delivery method is fired depends on the previous delivery method. After some tinkering
I have discovered that sum of the cost of each spell stage adds up to the cost of the spell as a whole. How this cost is 
interpreted depends on the power source. I'm sure that further perusing of my surroundings in the overworld will help discover more spell effects,
delivery methods, and power sources. Unfortunately, it currently appears that only whispers in the nightmare allow me to conjure up and edit new spells.
I hope to find a way to do this in the comfort of my home at some point, since Enaria will always find me eventually in the Nightmare.
If Enaria does manage to find me while I am spell crafting, any progress or work done on the current spell may be lost or distorted.
