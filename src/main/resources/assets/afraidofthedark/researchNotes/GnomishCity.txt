I have encountered an extensive underground city which I believe to have been created by... gnomes. This abandoned city is filled with bounties of
treasure, undead, and machines created by its former owners. These automatons, called Splinter Drones, guard the ruined hallways of their deceased or departed masters.
Splinter Drones are deadly with their rapid-fire plasma cannons and can easily mow down anything their perceive as a threat. Too bad they're fine with zombies and enchanted
skeletons... I am sure that I will eventually be able to modify a drone's friend or foe identification, so that it will follow and protect me.
