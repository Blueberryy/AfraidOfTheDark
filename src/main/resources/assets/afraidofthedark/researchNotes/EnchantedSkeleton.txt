I just witnessed a pile of bones become a living being. 
While enchanted skeletons do not do a lot of damage and appear simple to kill,
they recombine after being killed and re-animate like zombies. 
I should try to contain the enchanted bones separately to keep them from combining. As far as I
can tell, the bones are not useful for anything except bonemeal. I have also collected
all the other dye recipes here for reference.
