I have discovered strange gems inside of a meteor. I have named the gems sunstones for their warm feeling and
vibrant colors. Sunstones can be combined with diamonds to create igneous gems, powerful crystals which contain
trapped elemental fire within their latices. Igneous gems burn their holder severely, so caution must be taken
handling them. I should invest in a good fire blanket... If igneous gems are gathered, they can be crafted into
igneous armor, a powerful suit which renders the user impervious to damage from fire and resistant to lava. In
addition, when wearing a full suit of igneous armor, the armor lights any attackers on fire, regardless of the
attacks being ranged or physical. Igneous gems can also be made into a sword which lights enemies on fire. Striking
enemies builds up a magical charge. When the sword is at maximum charge, it glows with latent energy. When
energized, it can unleash a flaming tempest with a right click.
