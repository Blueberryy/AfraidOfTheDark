I have recently signed this very journal in my own blood. From what I've seen so far from
working with it, it appears to be otherworldly in origin. It also appears that I am the
only one who can read it. I suspect that the notes I write in it are stored in an
extra-dimensional location and then projected into my mind when I look at the pages. I 
further suspectthat If I were to lose track of this journal, I could just look for a
replacement and it wouldstill contain all of my original notes and reasearch. I have
decided to organize my reasearch in different sections based on relevance. I am certain
that new opportunities will open themselves to me as I uncover more information.I have finished tracking down a meteor. Its composition is a material similar to elemental silver. It can be made into
a sword, which seems to be about as effective as an iron sword. Its main characteristic is that it deals massive
damage to werewolves. It can also be made into crossbow bolts, which share the sword's ability to harm werewolves where
nothing else seems to work.I have finished tracking down a meteor. Its composition is a material similar to elemental silver. It can be made into

background of green stars. This place is insanity itself. I can almost feel my thoughts degrading. Although I
wish for nothing else but to leave, I know that I must stay and search for whatever treasure I may find here.
