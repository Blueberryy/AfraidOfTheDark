Upon rummaging around the insides of an asteroid, I have discovered a new material, which I have named
starmetal. Starmetal ingots are made by smelting starmetal fragments. If starmetal ingots are combined with iron ingots, they can be made
into starmetal plates,
which can then be forged into various tools and armor. Starmetal armor provides superior protection to
diamond, and gives the user an overshield which will absorb damage before the user. A starmetal khopesh
gains energy upon striking an enemy. When it reaches maximum charge, it will begin to shimmer with
arcane power. When at maximum charge, it can unleash a devastating area of effect slash by using right
click. In addition to the khopesh, a staff can be made out of starmetal. Every so often, the wielder can
activate the starmetal staff to jump on top of it, becoming invulnerable for several seconds, dodging everything
from arrows to cataclysmic world-annihilating explosions as if you rolled a natural 20 on your dodge check.
