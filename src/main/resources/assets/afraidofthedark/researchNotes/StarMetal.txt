Upon rummaging around the insides of an asteroid, I have discovered a new material, which I have named
starmetal. If starmetal fragments are combined with iron ingots, they can be made into starmetal plates,
which can then be forged into various tools and armor. Starmetal armor provides superior protection to
diamond, and gives the user an overshield which will absorb damage before the user. A starmetal sword
gains energy upon striking an enemy. When it reaches maximum charge, it will begin to shimmer with
arcane power. When at maximum charge, it can unleash a devastating area of effect slash by using right
click.
