I believe that I may have discovered a new substance. Whatever it is, I saw it vaporize an entire meteor.
If I could find more of this substance, I believe that I could make more accurate observations about
whatever this is. Perhaps this is similar to the forces of nature which cause random trees to rapidly grow.
I should look for a single abnormally tall tree with a fountain at its base.
