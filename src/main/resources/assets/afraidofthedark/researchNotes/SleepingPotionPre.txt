I've recently visitted an abandoned house in a forest. It looks like it was previously inhabited by some cult or
other. Where did they go? They left plently of white clothes behind along with other strange items. I've heard
before that some cult leaders will poison their followers by contaminating their drinking water somehow and
thus turning a cult into a mass suicide cult. Maybe I could test the water springs around the dark forest house.
Either way, I should bring a filled water bottle there to see what happens.
