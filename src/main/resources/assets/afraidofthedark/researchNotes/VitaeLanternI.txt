I have discovered my first practical application for vitae. It is a lantern energized from the power of nature.
Striking an enemy with the lantern will transfer a small amount of vitae into the
victim, causing them any range of the associated effects. Right-clicking a creature will result in the stealing of a small amount 
of vitae. This does not work on other players. The lantern does not in fact, emit light. The lantern
can be set to a certain vitae level (Default hold R key and left click) and it will attempt to keep your player's vitae at that level. 
For example, if the lantern is set at 50% and you absorb enough vitae to take you to 60%, the lantern will
absorb vitae until you are again at 50%. If your lantern is set at 90%, and you currently are at 50% vitae, 
the lantern will transfer vitae to you from its interior storage. Setting your lantern's vitae level to a higher
value will naturally make it more dangerous for the player; however, it will allow you a larger bank of vitae reserves
in time of need. (ex. spell casting, or vitae crafting *cough cough* coming soon)
