I have discovered my first practical application for vitae. It is a lantern energized from the power of nature.
Not only does the lantern accumulates vitae from the environment slowly, but it also restores the user's sanity
slowly. Stiking an enemy with the lantern will transfer an almost uncontrollable amount of vitae into the
victim, causing them any range of the associated effects. The lantern does not in fact, emit light. The lantern
can be set to a certain vitae level and it will attempt to keep your saturation at that level. For example, if
the lantern is set to keep you at a medium level and you absorb enough vitae to take you to high, the lantern will
absorb vitae until you are again at a medium level. The inverse is also true of being at a lower level than
what level your lantern is set to keep you at.
