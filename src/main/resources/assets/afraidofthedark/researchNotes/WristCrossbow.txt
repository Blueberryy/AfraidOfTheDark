Evidently, someone else shared my opinions on the uselessness of the crossbow and has invented an interesting solution. 
They have made the crossbow wrist mounted, leaving the reloading to a spring-loaded mechanism. 
This change will allow me to hold a weapon or tool while still firing projectiles on a short cool down.
 Now I'd better steal this person's notes and potions before they get back...
