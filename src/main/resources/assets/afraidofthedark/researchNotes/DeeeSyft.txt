The flying squidies are called DeeeSyft. They appear to be hollow and filled with a mixture of vitae and hydrogen.
This being the case, I should avoid setting them on fire for obvious reasons. They appear to siphon vitae from the
atmosphere and store it in their ventral chambers. I could use my lantern to harvest vitae from them in great supply
