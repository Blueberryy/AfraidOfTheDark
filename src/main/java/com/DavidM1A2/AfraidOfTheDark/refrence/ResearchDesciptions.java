From what I've seen so far from working with it, it appears to be otherworldly in origin. It also appears that I am the only one who can read it. I suspect that the notes I write in it are stored in an  extra-dimensional location and then projected into my mind when I look at the pages. I further suspect that If I were to lose track of this journal, I could just look for a replacement and it wouldstill contain all of my original notes and reasearch. I have decided to organize my reasearch in different sections based on relevance. I am certain that new opportunities will open themselves to me as I uncover more information. ";

They look extremely dangerous, but I cannot resist getting a closer look at them! They exist in abundance in eyrie forests, which is the first place I should start looking for them.";
	public static final String werewolfExamination = "     My encounter with the large wolves almost ended in my own death. From what I saw, I can determine that they are exremely hardy and almost impervious to conventional weapons. For now I should avoid them until I can find some... unconventional ways of killing them.";
