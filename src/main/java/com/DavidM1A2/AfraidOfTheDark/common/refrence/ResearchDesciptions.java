	public static final String anUnbreakableCovenant = "     I have recently signed this very journal in my own blood. From what I've seen so far from working with it, it appears to be otherworldly in origin. It also appears that I am the only one who can read it. I suspect that the notes I write in it are stored in an  extra-dimensional location and then projected into my mind when I look at the pages. I further suspect that If I were to lose track of this journal, I could just look for a replacement and it wouldstill contain all of my original notes and reasearch. I have decided to organize my reasearch in different sections based on relevance. I am certain that new opportunities will open themselves to me as I uncover more information.";
	public static final String preWerewolfExamination = "     I have noticed several monstrous wolves around the countryside. They look extremely dangerous, but I cannot resist getting a closer look at them! They exist in abundance in eyrie forests, which is the first place I should start looking for them.";
	public static final String werewolfExamination = "     My encounter with the large wolves almost ended in my own death. From what I saw, I can determine that they are exremely hardy and almost impervious to conventional weapons. For now I should avoid them until I can find some... unconventional ways of killing them.";
	public static final String crossbow = "     The journal I have recently discovered appears to contain the instructions to construct a crossbow aswell as several types of bolts. I am certain more uses for this crossbow will unveil themselves in the future.";
	public static final String astronomy1 = "     Success! My attempts at astrology and divination have yielded scientific answers! I spotted several types of meteors falling through the night sky. I think that if I follow these to their crash locations, I can discover useful materials.";
	public static final String preAstronomy1 = "     I have failed to kill the wolves. Science has failed to deliver rational answers to the source of their power. I will have to use unorthodox methods if I want to survive. I think that I should construct a telescope and take it to a high mountain. Perhaps the stars can provide answers to this problem which is clearly not of this world.";
	public static final String darkForest = "     It seems that I am not the first person to have the idea to explore this place. I found a small, yet deserted compound within the dark forest. I cannot shake this eyrie feeling of doom this place gives me.";
	public static final String preDarkForest = "     Despite my successes with astral silver, there is reason to be wanting more. I know there must be more advanced methods of combating werewolves and the undead legions. I recall once reading about areas in the world where strange energies caused trees to grow extraordinarily tall and twisted. I should visit one of these locations to perhaps enhance the quality of my astral silver tools. I should look for these forests in flat areas.";
