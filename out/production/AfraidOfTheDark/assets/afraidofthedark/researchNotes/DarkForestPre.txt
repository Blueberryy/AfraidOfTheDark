Despite my successes with astral silver, there is reason to be wanting more. I know there must be more
advanced methods of combating werewolves and the undead legions. I recall once reading about areas in the world
where strange energies caused trees to grow extraordinarily tall and twisted. I should visit one of these locations
to perhaps enhance the quality of my astral silver tools. I should look for these forests in flat areas.
