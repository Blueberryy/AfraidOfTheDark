After examining the void chest, I am certain that I can replicate some of the building blocks. These
blocks serve no purpose besides decoration. Maybe now I can make a scale model of the profane city R'lyeh.
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn! Cthulhu fhtagn! Cthulhu fhtagn! Yeah good luck pronouncing
that.
